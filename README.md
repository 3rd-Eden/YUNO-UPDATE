# YUNO UPDATE

![Y U NO UPDATE?](https://github.com/3rd-Eden/YUNO-UPDATE/raw/master/bin/example.png)

That is the question that Internet Explorer users should be asking them selfs. Because for some odd reason they don't think of that by them self I decided to script up a simple solution. So behold! `yuno.js` a simple lighweight script  that you can add to your site and it will ask your IE users to update. 

## Installation
Add a simple script tag to the bottom of your page and you are done:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/3rd-Eden/YUNO-UPDATE/blob/master/lib/yuno.min.js?v=7"></script>
```

### Configuration
You can tell the script which IE versions it should target by specifying the `v` parameter in the query string. In the example above the script will target all IE users that have version **LOWER** than 7.
